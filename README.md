# 01-HTML-Git-CSS - Horiseon

The goal for this homework assignment was to take an existing html file and improve both the SEO & accessability to meet industry standards. Through research into accessability requirements, I discovered tools like Lighthouse in Google Chrome dev tools, which I was able to use to ensure 100% scoring for both SEO & accessability.
